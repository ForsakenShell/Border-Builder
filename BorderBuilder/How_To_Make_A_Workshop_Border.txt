GUIBuilder v1.0.4.15

How to create a custom terrain following workshop border for your custom
settlement.


This document will be expanded on later, for now it's a quick'n'dirty run-down
on what you need to do and how to use GUIBuilder to do it.  This is done in a
pair of simple point lists, the first for what you need to do with the CK and
the second for how to create the NIF itself with GUIBuilder.


In the Creation Kit:

    a)  Create two new keywords in your settlement mod.  I recommend one with
        the EditorID suffix "_WorkshopBorderGenerator" (no quotes, duh) and the
        second with the suffix "_WorkshopBorderLink"; although neither of them
        need an EditorID at all you'll thank me later.
    b)  [Optional, as required] Create two new static object markers with the
        EditorID suffixes of "_TerrainFollowing" and "_ForcedZ" (again, no
        quotes and again, you'll thank me later).
        Pro-tip:    Copy two different colour vanilla "flag" markers to use as
                    your markers so you can easily differentiate them.
    c)  Place markers at the outside corners and intersections of your build
        volumes and link them in a clockwise order with the
        "_WorkshopBorderLink" keyword you created in the first step (a).
        NOTE:       It is important that your markers are linked in clockwise
                    order, it is this order that correctly assigns the "inside"
                    (green) and "outside" (red) textures of the border.
        Pro-tip:    Create a new layer for your border nodes and set it as the
                    active layer, freeze all other layers to avoid accidental
                    selection of references on those layers.  It may also be
                    helpful to turn off the visibility of the layers other than
                    the default layer and your custom layer.
        Pro-tip:    Switching the render window between perspective and
                    orthographic view ("0" (zero) in the render window) and
                    top-down ("T" in the render window) can help you can get
                    your markers as close to the corners/intersections/edges of
                    the build volumes as possible so they are the most
                    accurate.
        Pro-tip:    Use the "G" key in the render window to toggle local and
                    global axial movement.
        Pro-tip:    Set the rotation of your markers to the same rotation as
                    the build volume they sit on and then rotate them by 90
                    degrees so the "flag" points in the clockwise direction of
                    the link.
        Pro-tip:    Use the duplicate function ("control-D" in the render
                    window) for the next marker in the sequence and select
                    local translation ("G" in the render window) so you can
                    then use the axial move key ("Z"/"X"/"C" for Z/X/Y) to move
                    the new marker into position, this is especially useful if
                    you need to place "_ForcedZ" markers so that the border
                    stays straight between actual corners of the border.
        Pro-tip:    Place the all your markers, including the "_ForcedZ" on the
                    top of your build volumes so they are easier to find and
                    move; "_ForcedZ" markers need to be at the Z position you
                    want to force on the border for that section however,
                    placing and linking them on the top to start with is easier.
                    Once you have them all placed and linked, use the "F" key in
                    the render window with your "_ForcedZ" markers selected to
                    them "fall" to the ground (or whatever static they may be
                    over) then use the axial movement keys to fine-tune their
                    positions.
        NOTE:       It takes at least two "_ForcedZ" markers linked in sequence
                    in a "start-stop" manner; "_ForcedZ" segments use the Z
                    position of the markers starting at the first marker
                    encountered to the last "_ForcedZ" marker in the sequence.
                    Ideally your first and last "_ForcedZ" markers will be on
                    the actual ground so that the terrain following will create
                    as smooth a transition as possible, but this isn't strictly
                    necessary.
    d)  Link one of your border markers to the workshop with the
        "_WorkshopBorderGenerator" keyword.  Linking to the workshop this way
        allows mods can replace existing borders without touching the workshop
        the border is for (ie, vanilla workshops).
    e)  Save and exit


In GUIBuilder:

    a)  Load your settlement mod and make sure it's the "working file".
        Pro-tip:    Once your mod is loaded, use the "Create Workspace"
                    function for the future, this will record and use the same
                    settings everytime you want to work on your mod in
                    GUIBuilder.  This way instead of loading your plugin
                    directly you can load the workspace instead.
    b)  Open "Tools" > "Border Batch"
    c)  Select your workshop[s] in the list of workshops.
    d)  Select a target output folder, by default GUIBuilder tries to use
        "BorderBuilder\Output" but any folder can be used.  If you don't select
        an output folder, GUIBuilder will prompt you for one when you generate
        the NIF file[s].
    e)  Select the preset you want to use or create your own, "/GS" means "with
        ground sink".  See the main notes section at the bottom of this
        document for a full explaination of all the parameters.
    f)  Make sure your keywords and static markers that you created in steps
        (a) and (b) in the CK are selected in the "Node Detection" area.
        Really you only need to have the "_WorkshopBorderGenerator" selected
        but it will help to insure your mod is "correct" if you gave all the
        forms appropriate EditorIDs and GUIBuilder detects them.  If you only
        created the one required keyword it's ok, everything else can be left
        as "none".
    g)  Click "Gen. Nodes" to generate all the points required for the NIF[s]
        for the selected workshop[s].
    h)  Click "Build NIFs" to create the NIF[s] from the points generated in
        the previous step (g).
        [Optional]: Check the "Create Import Data" option for the next steps.
                    Without checking this GUIBuilder will not create any import
                    data and you will have to guess the position to place your
                    borders inside the CK/xEdit.
    i)  Click "Import NIFs", this will open an import window.
        NOTE:       The "Import NIFs" button won't enable if the workshop[s]
                    already have a border linked to them.  This is because the
                    new NIF[s] for the workshop[s] will be created based on the
                    original NIF[s] position.  This is done so that replacing
                    the border doesn't require any change to the plugin itself
                    (ie, if you are creating new NIFs for vanilla workshops
                    this means the static object and object reference do not
                    need any changes just the presence of the new NIF).
    h)  Click "Import" OR, record the "Extra Info" which is what the import
        process will do for a given form so that you can manually import the
        border NIF[s] in the CK or xEdit and perform those steps manually.


That's it.  You now have a border that is as perfect and accurate as you set
your markers up and the parameters you set to create the NIF[s].  No external
requirements, simple to update and fix.

Node Generation Parameters:

    Node Length:
        This is the "step size" for each node generated between the border
        markers placed and linked in the Creation Kit.  Larger node lengths
        will create NIF[s] with fewer vertexes and triangles but may have
        less accurate terrain following as fewer points on the terrain
        (heightmaps for the worldspace) are looked at.

    Angle Allowance & Slope Allowance:
        These two values control the node optimization where the nodes are
        merged if the angle or the slope is within the allowances between the
        current node and the two nodes after that.  If they are, the middle
        node is merged into the first node. Both angle and slope calculations
        look at the first and last nodes and, middle and last nodes.
        Slope is calculated as: delta Z / delta (X, Y) length

NIF Creation Parameters:

    Create Import Data:
        If checked, as the NIF[s] are created additional information will be
        generated to update the plugin including creating/updating the static
        object and object reference of the border itself for the workshop[s].

    Gradient Height:
        The height in game units of the gradient portion of the border NIF[s].

    Ground Offset:
        The height in game units of the solid portion that is above the terrain
        (or "_ForcedZ") of the border NIF[s].

    Ground Sink:
        The height in game units of the solid portion that is below the terrain
        (or "_ForcedZ")) of the border NIF[s].  This is used to account for
        inaccuracies of the terrain following and/or placement of "_ForcedZ"
        markers.  Regardless of this value, the lowest detected terrain height
        will be the base "bottom" of all nodes for the NIF and this is an
        adjustment to that value.

    Folders and Files will be created in this format:
        [Target Folder]\[Target Sub-Folder]\Meshes\[Target Mesh Folder]\[Mesh Sub-Folder]\[File Prefix][Workshop Name][File Suffix]01.nif
        OR
        [Target Folder]\[Target Sub-Folder]\Meshes\[Existing Border NIF file path name]

Node Detection Parameters:

    Restrict to:
        This restricts loading every form (of the appropriate type) into the
        dropdown control to only the working file.

    Keywords & Static Markers:
        These are the keywords in either all the loaded plugins or just the
        working file.  These should be set to the forms you created in steps
        (a) and (b) of the Creation Kit portion of this document.
        
        If a workspace has been created then only these forms are loaded when
        the workspace is loaded in the future.
        
        devnote: TODO: Toggling "Restrict To" will force all the appropriate forms to load.  [devnote: As it applies to workspaces, currently does not load forms]


HELP!  It didn't create any NIFs for me!

    First check the GUIBuilder.log folder.  While the program is running logs
    will be created in a date and time sub-folder with individual logs per
    thread.  By default, when the program terminates those logs will be zipped
    into a single file that has the same date and time as the sub-folder the
    zip file is created from.  Most log files are created with names that
    reflect their function.  Have a look at the log[s] and see if it's
    something like just a bad link.
    
    eg: "GetFirstBorderNode() returned null!" means that there were no markers
        linked to the workshop with your "_WorkshopBorderGenerator" keyword.
    
    If it's not something you overlooked, an ERROR or WARNING is present or,
    GUIBuilder crashed on you then please submit a bug report in the github
    issue tracker with steps to reproduce the issue along with the zipped logs
    with the date-time that show the error.
