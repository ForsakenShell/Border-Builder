        + NOTE: spline ref position +- spline ref XBSD = connection refs translated and rotated P-WS-Snap
                Need to load the connection ref NIF to get the snap point and rotate it into position to
                detect connections (so the snap point is "close" to the spline end point).  Wires can also
                be "fixed" as a result of having to do this.

+ NIF loader of extracted/loose NIFs
    + Snap points for power grid, etc
    + Possible worldspace heightmap modification by reference position + rotation of BSTriShape
        NOTE: Cache results for future use as this will be slow
