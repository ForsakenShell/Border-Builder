Fallout 4 Power Grid Notes:

All power connectors, generators, lamps, and splines placed in the CK require the workshop to have a "Power Grid" table filled with all the power connections for the workshop.  This table cannot be created in-game by script placed object (only player placed) thus we need to create it in the mod itself to work.  This file serves as my notes on how I have found the power grid system to work and all it's requirements.

"Reference" is an Object Reference that exists in a Cell.

"Power Reference" is a placed power connector, consumer, generator, terminal, etc.

"Base Form" is the activator, light, terminal, etc of the Reference.

"Power Grid" is a field (only viewable in xEdit) on the "WorkshopScript Reference".

What an object is and how it works is based primarily on keywords, actor values.

Power Reference Requirements:
    + Linked References:
        To WorkshopScript Reference with keyword WorkshopItemKeyword [KYWD:00054BA6]
    + Wired Connection Requirements:
        + CK   : A "Spline Reference" (REFR:BNDS) between the connectors of two different Power References
        + xEdit: "Spline Connection"[s] are required for wired connections.  All Spline Connections are bi-directional (A will link to B and B will link to A) and use the same Spline Reference on both Power References.

Base Form Requirements:
    + Keyword[s]:
        WorkshopPowerConnection [KYWD:00054BA4] - For wired connections
        WorkshopCanBePowered [KYWD:0003037E] - For consumers, some connectors (eg, the large vanilla power pylon)
        WorkshopStartPoweredOn [KYWD:0004455B] - For on/off switchable objects
        WorkshopStartUnpoweredOff [KYWD:0004455C] - For on/off switchable objects
        BlockPlayerActivation [KYWD:001CD02B] - For non switchable activators and or player interactable furniture
        WorkshopSwitchActivatorKeyword [KYWD:001690A4] - For on/off switchable objects
    + Optional Actor Values (PRPS - Properties):
        PowerGenerated [AVIF:0000032E] - Any positive value, this makes this connector a power generator
        PowerRadiation [AVIF:0000032F] - Any positive value, this controls the wireless transmission range for wireless consumers
        PowerRequired [AVIF:00000330] - Any positive value, this is the amount of power required for consumers
        WorkshopSnapTransmitsPower [AVIF:00000354] - 1.0, this controls whether the object makes power connections through snap points
        WorkshopCanBePoweredAV [AVIF:0024A03A] - ?, only used by VaultTec DLC for vault pieces
    + Any Form type allowed

WorkshopScript Reference Requirements:
    + Power Grid:
        This contains all the power connections in the settlement and are considered bi-directional.
        Every connection has two "Nodes" and optionally a "Line" between them.
        What Power Reference is what Node does not matter but that Node pair will only exist once in the entire Power Grid.
        Wired connections will have the Line set to the Spline Reference for the connection.
        If a connection is wireless or through a snap point, it will still have a connection in the Power Grid but it will have no Line.
